Bots for some games in https://theuselessweb.com/
## How to use
1. Find the script
2. Copy it
3. Open DevTools on site (Windows:`F12`, macOS:`IDK because I don't have a Mac, if you have, create a issue to tell me!`)
4. Click `Console`
5. Paste the code
6. Done! The bot should be running now!
Or... Wait we make an all-in-one version?
